    Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) are in here. Maybe floating?
    They get their basics from the Basesign but keep the air qualities too which we want, so we can see the difference between all signs
    Air signs are chatty but also chaotic. Never think they are airheads though.
    Can be crazy over thinkers however! :/
